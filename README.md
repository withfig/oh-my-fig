# ðŸ˜Ž Oh My Fig 

> Natural text and cursor editing for the terminal

This incredibly fast, simple, and opionated plugin by the [Fig](https://fig.io?ref=github) team makes it feel like you're typing in Google or your editor, rather than something frmo the 1970s...

### What it does
* Natural editing
  * Natural keybindings:
    *  `cmd+arrow` jumps you to start / end of line
    *  `opt+arrow` jump forward / backward word
    *  `cmd+delete` deletes line
    *  `opt+delete` deletes word
  *  Thin blinking cursor (`|` not `â–Š`)
* Up arrow history substring search

That's it! Small, opionated, and fast.
